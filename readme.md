4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?  
-> Answer :  
**Event Delegation** is a way where we add event listener to parent instead of adding to each child and catch the child's event also using that single event listener.  
It reduces the amount of event listener and helpful to reduce the chance for events to bubbling up to parent.  
It is also helpful in another useful case - when we append a child into the parent, we need to add event listener while appending but in this way we can append as many child as we want without adding event listener as the event is being handled from the parent element or the parent is same for handling the event.
